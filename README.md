# Yoga Pose Detection Model

This repository contains a deep learning model for detecting yoga poses using the Xception architecture of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The model is trained to recognize various yoga poses from input images or videos.

## Overview

Yoga is a popular practice for physical, mental, and spiritual well-being. With the growing interest in yoga and the proliferation of digital technologies, there is an increasing demand for tools that can assist practitioners in improving their yoga practice. This project aims to address this demand by developing a computer vision-based model capable of automatically detecting and recognizing yoga poses.

## Features

- **Yoga Pose Detection**: The model can detect and classify various yoga poses in images or videos.
- **Exception Architecture**: The model architecture is based on the exception architecture of CNN, known for its effectiveness in handling complex visual data.
- **Pre-trained Model**: A pre-trained model is provided, trained on a diverse dataset of yoga poses.
- **Easy Integration**: The model can be easily integrated into existing applications or used for research purposes.

## Installation

To use the yoga pose detection model, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository:

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/yoga-pose-detection.git
    ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

3. Download the pre-trained weights for the model (if not provided in the repository).

## Usage

To detect yoga poses in real time, you can use the **yoga.ipynb** model or integrate the model into your own application.
